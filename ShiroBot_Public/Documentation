HOW TO USE THE SHIRO BOT

()=required
[optional]
member = tagged user


bot.remove_command("help")
    removes the preset 'help' command generated by discord.py lib
    so we can make our own

on_ready
    we print useful information and set the starting presence

loop_task
    loops the while contents, currently used to change presence
    loops every loop_time

on_message
    quick responses that require no prefix

on_command_error
    will return the error when there is error by the user
    it isnt 100% working

^The above functions run on their own, when something happens
